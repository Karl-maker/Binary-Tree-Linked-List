I am yet what I am none cares or knows
My friends forsake me like a memory lost
I am the self-consumer of my woes
They rise and vanish in oblivious host 
Like shadows in love’s frenzied stifled throes 
And yet I am, and live—like vapours tossed 

I long for scenes where man hath never trod 
A place where woman never smiled or wept 
There to abide with my Creator God 
And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept 
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie 
The grass below—above the vaulted sky
